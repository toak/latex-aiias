Warning: you should feel comfortable to explore LateX and invest time first to save time later :) - use it of papers only, it is powerful and it makes sense when it comes to document structure, citing, etc

Here is a very useful introduction and reference: https://www.overleaf.com/learn

## Writing environment

For a simple usage of LateX use https://www.overleaf.com/ You can use SSO with your aiias.edu account and the free edition should be enough for you. Just create a blank project, copy the files from the source folder and start editing it in overleaf!

You can also install LateX locally on your computer (but not even I do it).

## Simple paper

You can use this for short papers, you will find the source files and the results in the folder /simple-paper. The *.tex and *.bib can be found in the source folder

### title.tex

Here is the place for your name and title of the paper

### context.tex

Here is the place for the content of your paper

### Bibliography.bib

Add your references here, get the notation from books.google.com - when you are viewing a book, click on "About this book" and download the BiBTeX file at the end of the page. Insert the content in this file.

### main.tex

Leave it untouched if you don't have to change the style of the document. If you create a more sophisticated paper styles, make sure you send me the this file. I will include it in this repo.

### AIIAS___Simple_paper.pdf

The PDF file is created by overleaf.com or your local LateX installation.
